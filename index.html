            <p>Now, seeing the conflict at an end, and that his master was ready to mount again upon Rozinante, he came up to hold his stirrup ; but, before he had mounted, fell upon his knees before him, then, taking hold of his hand, and kissing it, said to him, ” Be pleased, my lord Don Quixote, to bestow upon me the government of that island which you have won in this dreadful battle ; for, be it ever so big, I feel in myself ability suffi cient to govern it, as well as the best that ever governed island in the world.” To which Don Quixote answered, ” Consider, brother Sancho, that this adventure, and others of this nature, are not adventures of islands, but of cross-ways, in which nothing is to be gained but a broken head, or the loss of an ear. Have patience; for adventures will offer, whereby I may not only make thee a governor, but something yet greater.” Sancho returned him abundance of thanks, and, kiss ing his hand again, and the skirt of his armour, he helped him to get upon Rozinante ; then, mounting his ass, he followed his master, who, going off at a round pace, without taking his leave, or spiking to those in the coach, im mediately entered into an adjoining wood.</p>
              <p>Sancho followed him as fast as his beast could trot; but Rozinante made such speed that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call aloud to his master to stay for him. Don Quixote did so, checking Rozinante by the bridle, until his weary squire overtook him ; who, as soon as he came near, said to him, ” Methinks, sir, it would not be amiss to retire to some church; for, considering in what condition you have left your adver sary, I should not wonder if they give notice of the fact to the holy brotherhood, who may seize us ; and in faith, if they do, before we get out of their clutches we may chance to sweat for it.” ” Peace,” quoth Don Quixote ; ” for where hast thou ever seen or read of a knight-errant having been brought before a court of justice, however numerous the homi cides he may have committed ? ” ”I know nothing of your Omecils,” answered Sancho ; ” nor in my life ever cared about them : only this I know, that the holy brotherhood have something to say to those who fight in the fields; and, as to the other matter, I shall have nothing to do with it.” ” Set thy heart at rest, friend,” answered Don Quixote ; ” for I would deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the holy brotherhood. But tell me, on thy life, hast thou ever seen a more valorous knight than I upon the whole face of the earth ? Hast thou read in history of any one who has, or ever had, more spirit in attacking, more breath in hold ing out, more dexterity in wounding, or more address in overthrowing?” ”The truth is,” answered Sancho, ” that I never read any history at all ; for I can neither read nor write : but what I dare affirm is that I never served a bolder master than your worship, in all the days of my life ; and pray God we may not be called to an account for this boldness, where I just now said. What I beg of your worship is that you would let your wound be dressed, for a great deal of blood comes from that ear : and I have some lint, and a little white ointment, here in my wallet.” ” All this would have been needless,” answered Don Quixote, ” had I recollected to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras ; for, with one single drop of that, we might have saved both time and medicine.” ” What vial, and what balsam is that?” said Sancho Panza. ”It is a balsam,” answered Don Quixote, ” the receipt of which I hold in memory ; and he who possesses it need not fear death, nor apprehend that any wound will be fatal : therefore, when I shall have made it, and given it to thy care, all thou wilt have to do, when thou seest me in some battle cleft asunder (as it frequent ly happens), is, to take up fair and softly that part of my body which shall fall to the ground, and, with the greatest nicety, before the blood is congealed, place it upon the other half that shall remain in the saddle, taking especial care to make them tally exactly. Then shalt thou give me two draughts only of the balsam aforesaid, and instantly thou wilt see me become sounder than an apple.” ” If this be so,” said Sancho, ” I renounce from hence forward the government of the promised isl and ; and only desire, in payment of my many and good services, that your worship will give me the receipt of this extraordinary liquor ; for I dare say it will any where fetch more than two reals an ounce ; and I want no more to pass this life with credit and comfort.</p>
